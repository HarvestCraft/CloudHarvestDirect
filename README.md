- **Validation of Character Set Input**: Input validation ensures that the character set is not empty, preventing runtime errors.

#### 7. Performance Improvements

- **Optimized Asynchronous I/O**: Code optimizations have been made to the asynchronous functions, improving the efficiency of network operations.
- **Efficient Task Scheduling**: Improved task management logic leads to better scheduling and execution of tasks, reducing idle times and increasing throughput.
- **Reduced Overhead**: Switching to a multiprocessing queue for matched URLs and introducing a dedicated saver thread reduces inter-process communication overhead.

#### 8. Code Comments and Documentation

- **Comprehensive Inline Comments**: The codebase now includes detailed inline comments that explain the functionality of code blocks and individual lines where necessary.
- **Function Documentation**: Each function is accompanied by a docstring or comment that describes its purpose, inputs, and outputs.
- **Section Headers**: The code is divided into logical sections with headers, making navigation and understanding of the code structure more straightforward.

Thank you for using **CloudHarvestDirect Harvest Tool Beta 3**. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for further improvements, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: Efficiently handles a high number of concurrent requests for large-scale link checking.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Start, stop, and monitor the progress of your link checking tasks through an intuitive interface.
- **Customizable Starting Point**: Define a starting point for the link combinations to focus on specific segments of the identifier space.
- **Artist File Integration**: Narrow down your search by focusing on specific artists through an easy-to-create artist file.
- **Save and Load State**: Save your progress and resume scanning from where you left off.
- **Character Set Customization**: Specify a custom character set for generating link combinations.

## Creating an Artist File

### Purpose

An artist `.txt` file allows you to target your search to links associated with specific artists, avoiding unrelated private links. This feature is particularly useful when you want to focus on specific artists.

### Format

- Each line in the artist file should contain the full URL of the artist's SoundCloud page, ending with a `/`.
- Example entry: `https://soundcloud.com/artistname/`
- The trailing slash at the end of the artist URL ensures that only exact matches are considered.
- **File Format**: Save the file with a `.txt` extension.

### Usage

- **Including an Artist File**: When an artist file is included, the script will only save private links that match the URLs listed in the file.
- **No Artist File Provided**: If no artist file is provided, the script will save all discovered private links.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Basic command line knowledge.
- Required Python packages:
  - `aiohttp`
  - `tkinter` (usually comes pre-installed with Python)


### Steps to Use on Windows:

1. Open the command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder containing the script using `cd PATH_TO_FOLDER_WITH_SCRIPT`.
3. Run the script with `python HarvestTool.py`.

### Steps to Use on Mac:

1. *No fucking idea, I'm poor.*
2. You MUST install ` install certificates.command ` from the python folder on your mac or you will get SSL errors.

## Technical Details

### Vulnerability Overview

- **Link Structure**: SoundCloud uses shortened links (e.g., `https://on.soundcloud.com/xxxxx`) where `xxxxx` is a five-character identifier.
- **Brute-Force Potential**: The identifier can be brute-forced to find valid links to private content. Although there are theoretically 916 million possible combinations, the actual number is lower due to restrictions such as:
  - Identifiers cannot start with a 0.
  - Certain characters or combinations might be excluded for usability or aesthetic reasons.
  - Additional internal rules may further limit valid identifiers.

### Script Functionality

- **Link Generation**: The script generates all possible combinations of the identifier within the defined constraints.
- **Link Testing**: Each generated link is tested to determine if it corresponds to a valid private track or playlist. This is achieved by catching the redirect (HTTP 302 response) from the shortened link to the full SoundCloud URL.
- **Private Content Detection**: A regex is used to identify if the full link contains a private token, which is unique to private tracks and playlists.
- **Output Handling**: Valid private links are saved in a JSON file for further review or action.

### Handling Duplicate Links

- **Duplicate Links**: Duplicates may occur due to redirection caching, multiple identifiers for the same track, or network latency. The script handles these, but repeated entries may still appear.

### False Positives

The regex filter may cause some false positives, such as:

- **Old Private Tracks**: Tracks that were once private but are now public may still retain the private token in their URLs.
- **Deleted Tracks**: Links to deleted tracks might also match the regex, leading to incorrect identification as private content.
