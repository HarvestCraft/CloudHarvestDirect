# SoundCloud Link Checker

## Overview

This script is designed to automate the process of checking SoundCloud links to find private or hidden tracks. It generates combinations of link identifiers, checks if they redirect to valid SoundCloud URLs, and saves any valid matches to an output file. The script includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built with `tkinter` for ease of use.

## Features

- **Concurrency**: The script can handle a high number of concurrent requests, making it efficient for large-scale link checking.
- **GUI**: A user-friendly interface for starting, stopping, and monitoring the progress of the link checker.
- **Customizable Starting Point**: Allows you to define a starting point for the link combinations.
- **Artist File Integration**: You can provide a file with specific artist URLs to focus the search on relevant links.
